How to Change the Fake Wi-Fi Names (SSIDs):

Your tool broadcasts fake Wi-Fi names from a hardcoded list in the script and optionally from a config text file.

To change them, do the following:

1. Open the Python script file `ssid_broadcaster.py`.

2. Find the function called `start_airbase(self)`.

3. Inside this function, youâ€™ll see a line like:

   ssids = ["Iphone12", "...", "nemoze da se konektiras", "smrdam"]

4. Replace this list with your desired fake Wi-Fi names, for example:

   ssids = ["Starbucks_FREE", "NSA_SURVEILLANCE_VAN", "Free_WiFi", "HackMeIfYouCan"]

5. Save the script.

6. (Optional) You can also change the list of fake Wi-Fi names in the config text file:

   - Open or create the file `config/ssid_list.txt`

   - Add one fake Wi-Fi name per line, for example:

     Starbucks_FREE  
     Android_Hotspot  
     PoliceSurveillanceVan  
     nemoze da se konektiras

7. If you want the script to load SSIDs from the config file instead of the hardcoded list, you need to modify the script to read from it (not currently automatic).

8. Run the script again, and it will broadcast the fake Wi-Fi names as defined.

Summary:

- To quickly change fake Wi-Fi names, edit the list in the script (`start_airbase` function).

- To maintain a separate list, edit the `config/ssid_list.txt` file (requires script modification to load).

Let me know if you want me to update the script to automatically load SSIDs from the config file.
