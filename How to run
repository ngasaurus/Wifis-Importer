Notes:

Replace "wlan0" and "wlan0mon" with your actual Wi-Fi interface names if different

Replace "at0" in dnsmasq config if your interface is named otherwise

You’ll see the MAN banner on terminal at start

The GUI downloads and uses the fsociety mask image as faint background

Start and stop attack buttons control everything — fake APs, DHCP/DNS, and Flask phishing server
